<!DOCTYPE html> <!--<!DOCTYPE html> is a declaration at the beginning of an HTML document that tells the web browser which version of HTML the document is using. 
The term "DOCTYPE" stands for "Document Type Declaration". It is not an HTML tag, but rather an instruction to the web browser about how to interpret the code that follows. -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- In this case, "en" indicates that the language of the document is English. This information can be used by web browsers and search engines to improve the accessibility and relevance of the content for users who speak that language. -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- Metadata is data about data and describes various aspects of the document, such as the author, keywords, description, character set, and other information that is not visible on the page but is useful for search engines, social media platforms, and other applications. -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> <!-- The "X-UA-Compatible" value is a non-standard attribute that was introduced by Microsoft to provide compatibility with older versions of Internet Explorer. content="IE=edge" would tell Internet Explorer to render the document in the latest version of the browser's engine, regardless of the version specified in the browser's settings. -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- "viewport" meta tag is telling the browser that the width of the viewport should be equal to the width of the device, and the initial zoom scale should be set to 1.0. This means that the web page will be scaled to fit the screen size of the device and the content will be rendered at the appropriate size and scale. -->
